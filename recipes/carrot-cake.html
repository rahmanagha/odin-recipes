    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients">
      <li>
        <strong>Sugars:</strong> You'll need white sugar for the cake and
        confectioners' sugar for the frosting.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Oil:</strong> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, adds
        moisture without imparting flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Eggs:</strong> Four whole eggs lend moisture and help bind the
        carrot cake batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vanilla:</strong> Two teaspoons of vanilla extract for the cake
        (and one teaspoon for the frosting) enhances the flavor.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Carrots:</strong> Of course, you'll need grated carrots!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <strong>Make the batter:</strong> Beat the wet ingredients together,
        then mix in the dry ingredients. Stir in the carrots and fold in the
        pecans.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Bake the cake:</strong> Pour the batter into the prepared cake
        pan or pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out
        clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Frost the cake:</strong> Beat the frosting ingredients together
        until smooth and creamy. Stir in the pecans. Frost the (completely
        cooled) cake.
