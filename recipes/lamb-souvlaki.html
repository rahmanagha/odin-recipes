    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lamb souvlaki with marinated pieces of lamb, threaded on skewers, and
      char-grilled to perfection. I like to serve these with rosemary garlic
      roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>&frac13; cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 &frac12; tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>&frac12; teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>&frac14; teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>
        1 &frac12; pounds boneless leg of lamb, trimmed of all fat and cut into
        1-inch cubes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt,
        and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb
        is coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade.
        Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the
        reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.
